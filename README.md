# Password Generator

## Description
I've created a random password generator that takes in the user's preference when making a new password.

## Use Instructions
Click "generate password" button then enter your preferred password length that is between 8 and 128 characters. Numbers outside of that range and NaN's will not be allowed, thus reprompting the user. To input preference in using lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers, or symbols you can either click "Ok" or "Cancel". After inputting your preferences, your unique password will be displayed on the page.
